# Product Catalog

A responsive Angular application built with standalone components, TypeScript, and modern Angular patterns. This repository is part of my Angular learning and portfolio series.

## Project details

- **Author:** Ramu Boya
- **Language:** TypeScript
- **Focus:** HttpClient-style service abstraction, routing, search, category filters, pagination
- **Difficulty:** Intermediate
- **GitHub:** https://github.com/Ramu-fsd/angular-product-catalog

## Features

- Browse a local product catalog.
- Search and filter by category.
- Sort by price and paginate results.
- Product data is supplied locally for a deterministic demo.

## Tech stack

- Angular 20
- TypeScript (strict mode)
- Standalone components
- Angular Signals where appropriate
- HTML5 and CSS3
- Jasmine and Karma unit tests

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js version supported by Angular 20 (use a current Node.js LTS release)
- npm
- Angular CLI 20 (optional; the local CLI is used by npm scripts)

Check your versions:

```bash
node -v
npm -v
npx ng version
```

### Install dependencies

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ramu-fsd/angular-product-catalog.git
cd angular-product-catalog
npm install
```

### Run locally

```bash
npm start
```

Open http://localhost:4200.

### Run unit tests

```bash
npm test
```

Karma launches Chrome by default. If Chrome does not launch automatically, check the browser launcher configuration and your local Chrome installation.

### Production build

```bash
npm run build
```

The production output is generated under `dist/`.

## Learning outcomes

- Feature-oriented organization and typed models.
- Router navigation and query-independent local filtering.
- Service abstraction that can later be replaced with HttpClient.

## Notes

- This is a portfolio/learning project, not a production authentication or commerce backend.
- Demo data is local unless explicitly stated otherwise.
- Keep `package-lock.json` committed so installs are reproducible.
- Do not commit `node_modules/`, build output, secrets, or real environment credentials.
